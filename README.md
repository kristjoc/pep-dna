<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
## Introduction

PEP-DNA is a Performance Enhancing Proxy designed specifically for Deploying new
Network Architectures. It is implemented in the Linux kernel and can be
installed wherever a translation needs to occur between a new architecture and
TCP/IP domains. PEP-DNA is currently able to interconnect a TCP connection with
(i) another TCP connection, (ii) the Recursive InterNetwork Architecture (Visit
<http://pouzinsociety.org> to read more about RINA), and (iii) a Content-Centric
Networking domain
(<https://named-data.net/publications/van-ccn-bremen-description/>). This
`README.md` file provides information on repeating and replicating the results
of the PEP-DNA paper published. For more information on how to use PEP-DNA in
different scenarios, check the
[Tutorials](<https://github.com/kr1stj0n/pep-dna/wiki/Tutorials>) on the <a
href="https://github.com/kr1stj0n/pep-dna/wiki">Wiki</a> pages.

<!-- BUILD INSTRUCTIONS -->
## Build instructions

We have tested PEP-DNA with the current stable distribution of Ubuntu and
Debian, with kernel versions between 4.1.x to 5.4.x. In order to run all the
experiments described in the paper, PEP-DNA needs to be built with RINA and CCN
support. We use the RINA stack, which is available at
<https://github.com/IRATI/stack>, and CCN-lite, which can be found at
<https://github.com/cn-uofbasel/ccn-lite>, to build RINA and CCN network. To
facilitate the installation process, we include the RINA stack and CCN-lite in
this repository.

**Note** that a user with sudo privileges is required to load PEP-DNA and RINA
kernel modules apply other commands.

### Prerequisites

First, install the user-space dependencies which are required to build RINA.

  ```sh
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install build-essential autoconf automake libtool pkg-config git
    g++ libssl-dev libelf-dev protobuf-compiler libprotobuf-dev socat python python3
    openjdk-8-jre openjdk-8-jdk linux-headers-$(uname -r)
  ```

Next, use the following to install the requirements for CCN-lite:

  ```sh
    sudo apt-get install cmake libssl-dev pkg-config libssl-dev libcmocka-dev
    doxygen
  ```

Install libnl-3-dev for Netlink sockets support.

  ```sh
    sudo apt-get install libnl-3-dev
  ```

Additional tools are required to configure Linux hosts, run the experiments and
collect information.

  ```sh
    sudo apt-get install sysstat ethtool cpufrequtils httping httperf apache2
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository (We recommend to clone the repo in the home directory so
   that it matches the path used in the scripts.)

   ```sh
     cd ~
     git clone https://github.com/kr1stj0n/pep-dna.git
   ```

2. Build and install RINA's kernel-space and user-space software

   ```sh
     cd ~/pep-dna/rina-stack
     sudo ./configure
     sudo -E make install
   ```

3. Build CCN-lite

    - Set environment variable `$CCNL_HOME` and add the binary folder of CCN-lite to your `$PATH`:
      ```sh
        cd ~/pep-dna/ccn-lite
        export CCNL_HOME="`pwd`"
        export PATH=$PATH:"$CCNL_HOME/bin"
      ```
    To make these variables permanent, add them to your shell's `.rc` file, e.g. `~/.bashrc`.

    - Build CCN-lite using `cmake`:
      ```sh
        cd $CCNL_HOME
        mkdir build && cd build
        cmake ..
        make
      ```

4. Configure and install PEP-DNA

   ```sh
     cd ~/pep-dna/pepdna
     ./configure --with-rina --with-ccn --with-local-receiver
     make all
     sudo -E make install
   ```

To configure PEP-DNA with RINA support or CCN suport `--with-rina` or
`--with-ccn` flags needs to be used. Use `--with-debug` to build PEP-DNA with
DEBUG flag.  **Note** that building in debug mode will reduce the performance
of the proxy and print detailed logging in the `/var/log/kern.log` file. When PEP-DNA
runs at the same host as the receiver, a.k.a the TCP server,
it needs to be configured with `---with-local-receiver` flag in order to enable full transpacency at this case.
Configure the proxy using `--with-local-sender` if PEP-DNA is running at the same host as the sender, a.k.a TCP client.
More details about the building process can be found at the Wiki section. For our experiments, the commands
above are sufficient.

All the testing applications and scripts used to run the experiments, collect
the results and plot the graphs are located in
<https://github.com/kr1stj0n/pep-dna/tree/main/pepdna/utils/apps>.</br>
Run the following commands to install them to `/usr/bin/`.

  ```sh
    cd ~/pep-dna/pepdna/utils/apps
    make all
    sudo -E make install
  ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Reproducibility

We aim to make our work entirely reproducible and encourage interested
researchers to test the code and replicate the reported experimental
results. The PEP-DNA implementation and documentation needed to reproduce all
the experiments described in the paper are available in this public
repository. The tools we developed to the run the experiments were installed at
Step 4 of the previous section. The scripts for automated testing, analysis and
plotting of the generated data are located at
<https://github.com/kr1stj0n/pep-dna/tree/main/pepdna/utils/scripts/> alongside
with a detailed `README_scripts.md` file. Read the `README_scripts.md` file for
a detailed explanation on how to set the variables for your own testbed
environment, run all the experiments and plot the generated dataset.
